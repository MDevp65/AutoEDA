# AutoEDA: Automated Exploratory Data Analysis for CSV Files

**AutoEDA** is an open-source web application designed to simplify and accelerate the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for CSV data. By uploading a CSV file, users can quickly generate a comprehensive analysis report, gaining valuable insights into their data with minimal effort.

### Key Features:

1. **Automated EDA**: Streamlines the data exploration process.
2. **CSV File Upload**: Users upload their data in CSV format.
3. **Instant Analysis Reports**: Receive a detailed report after uploading.
4. **React and FastAPI**: Built using a modern web stack (React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend).
5. **Pandas Profiling**: Uses the powerful Pandas Profiling library to generate the analysis reports in HTML format.

### How to Use:

- Upload a CSV file.
- The application automatically analyzes the data.
- Download an HTML report containing the analysis.
- Technical Details:

AutoEDA demonstrates how to connect a React frontend with a FastAPI backend to perform data processing. The backend leverages Pandas Profiling to generate detailed analysis reports.

### Open Source and Contributions:

This is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, modify the code, and enhance the application.

### Potential Enhancements:

- Add user authentication.
- Support additional report formats (e.g., JSON, PDF).
- Implement more advanced data analysis features.
This project serves as a starting point for building more sophisticated data analysis tools.
